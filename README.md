# Business-Analytics-with-People-Counter
 Restaurant Business Analytics for the price, discount, etc prediction with people counting web app
 
 - Innovative solution for gaining profit in standalone startup restaurants. According to many reports, the main factor that determines a restaurant's profit is the people count. So we have proposed a solution where a restaurant's past history of prices, dishes, and such factor's transaction has been taken into account and providing a recommendation for the price to be fixed for a particular day, the dish quantity to be prepared, etc.

- Trend analysis is much more important, for that we use tableau, which provides real-time public inference on data, here the owners can check their past transaction and analyze the trend.
